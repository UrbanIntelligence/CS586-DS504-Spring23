# Project 5 [Group (1-5 people)]

#### Project Description:
* You will work with your teammates in the team project on a big data analytics problem involving multiple (more than one) datasets. That is, projects may involve the utilization of big data analytics tools to extract knowledge from multiple real world datasets to address practical challenges; and/or the development of new or the extension of existing tools with advanced features. You can find some example project ideas below.

# Project Ideas
* You can participate some competitions
  * [NeurIPS 2020 Competition Track](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/CompetitionTrack)
  * [COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19)](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)
  * [HuBMAP - Hacking the Kidney](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hubmap-kidney-segmentation)
  * [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/): An online machine learning competition website.
* You may consider some ideas like,
  * A traffic pattern learner that would apply data mining techniques to both traffic archives (taxi dataset) and online traffic patterns (California traffic) to learn about typical routes of taxis, congestions in the form of clusters, open parking spaces, outliers in traffic, or to recommend routes.
  * A social media barometer tool that performs analytics on twitter data, aggregated by location and time, to determine periods or places with heavy flu patterns. Heterogenous data from mobile phones or other sensors that also provides information about the number of people in a given space could be utilized to further enhance the quality of the predicted results.
  * A movie recommender, that based on the UCI movie data set maybe together with a second data set from what is playing right now in the theatres would perform analytics to learn about what features tend to lead to block busters, e.g., certain combinations of actors, certain topics, for certain age groups, etc.
  * An application that analyzes the DBES soccer sensor data set 2013 to learn about different features prevalent in such a real-life game, e.g., what situation lead to a goal, who had the most chances for a goal, what team dominated in the play, etc.
* Instead, do put your own much cooler project idea here that really rocks ...

## Deliverables
* STAGE 1: Project Proposal.
Each group will turn in a typed proposal document (about 2 pages) defining the finalized project. You should have thought about your proposed work, and possibly tried to solve some initial part of it. Make sure to have dug in enough to understand the feasibility of your proposed direction, and/or to have looked at the necessary background knowledge and skills needed to pursue the project. This proposal should explain the proposed work to be done. You should also list relevant environment (tools) you have set up or papers you have read in order to succeed to complete the project. Do provide an expected schedule for your planned completion, including a list of tasks to be undertaken week by week, and the deliverables for the end of the course.<br>

* STAGE 2: Project Progress.
This progress report should clearly state the current status of the project. This report must be typed. Typically it is about 5 pages long. By this time, I would expect you to be already half way towards completing your project. Teams routinely loose points for this stage, if they have not succeeded to make sufficient progress. I would expect you to have conducted all necessary background work including establishing a bibliography and reading relevant manuals and literature, installing and testing all necessary software, resolving specific design issues, and refining the project plan or possibly re-directing the effort based on your background studies. Also, there needs to be a clear plan of what will be accomplished by the end of the project. You must develop a precise schedule and task list for the remainder of the project.<br>

* Stage 3: Final Project.
Finally, the complete project is delivered. You are expected to produce and submit a professional report on your project, complete with a clear motivation, full description with examples, and careful evaluation of the effectiveness of the solution. In addition, the presentation and demonstration of your solution, as appropriate, will be done in class by each team. We'll determine the exact time allowed per project later. See below to learn about what aspects should be stressed in this presentation.<br>
This presentation must be supplemented with a final project report due at the same time. This report should be a well-written technical report describing your project. It is fine and in fact likely that this report will be a direct extension of your progress report. Depending on the nature of your project, it will need to contain a detailed description of your data set, of your system, key technologies used, experimental charts, sample runs, a detailed analysis of the results. The report typically is about 10 pages.

## Grading
* **PDF Report (40 points)**
* **Presentation (30 points)**
* **Code (30 points)**

**Project Grading in General**

The final grade of the team project (which may not necessarily be the same for each member of the team) will be based on :
* the difficulty of the project you have chosen to work on, and the effort you have put into formulating your problem and identifying relevant techniques to solve your problems,
* your solution approach and techniques utilized and the quality and effort of execution,
* the oral project presentation (covering the problem your group tackled, your solution approach, and your results at the end of the course),
* the written documentation of your project in the form of a report (which you will make accessible to other students in the class),
* the demonstration of your system (including successful example runs), as applicable and
* the understanding of each team member of his or her part of the project, as well as of the overall group product.
